GETTING STARTED
===============

    
	To compile Npgsql from cvs, do the following:
 
    Get Npgsql source from anon gborg cvs:
    
    cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@gborg.postgresql.org:/usr/local/cvsroot/npgsql login
    
    When it asks for a password, type: anonymous
    
    It will start download Npgsql sources in a folder called Npgsql.


COMPILING
=========

    To compile Npgsql, first get NAnt: nant.sf.net
    Go to Npgsql/src/Npgsql folder and execute NAnt from command line.
    
    It will create a folder called build/ms where you will find the two assemblies you need to run Npgsql: Npgsql.dll and the Tls library assembly. 
      

INSTALL
=======

    Just copy the resulting .dll's to application directory.
